Won't it all end?

I was overthinking -as almost always- and I thought, won't it all end?! Like everything is destined to end, all life, feelings, and everything.

All the pain we have been through will end, so will the joy and all the great moments, _they will end_.

All the rude people, all the kind people, all the wonderful times, all the griefs and sorrow. Some moments might feel like they will never end, but how many times we have been through all of this and they have just ended?!

No matter what you are feeling right know, **it will end.** Some day these will be memories, before we ourselves die. We always got the choice to make, what kind of memories do we want to make?

I wish you and me the best of luck, just know, nothing lasts, so keep a strong hold to your best moments, and always remember them very well before they end ❤️
